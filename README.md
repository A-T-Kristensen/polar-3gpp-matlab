# polar-3gpp-matlab
Matlab simulations of the encoder and SCL decoder for the New Radio polar code from 3GPP Release 15

At the time of writing, the most recent version of the relevant 3GPP standard is [TS38.212 V1.2.1](https://list.etsi.org/scripts/wa.exe?A3=ind1712B&L=3GPP_TSG_RAN_WG1&E=base64&P=43462493&B=--_004_543CF4C91C60E844AE997DC07D4CC64501A96F30DGGEML504MBSchi_&T=application%2Fx-zip-compressed;%20name=%22R1-17xxxxx%20TS38.212%20v1.2.1%20201712101800.zip%22&N=R1-17xxxxx%20TS38.212%20v1.2.1%20201712101800.zip&attachment=q&XSS=3).

Many thanks to my colleagues at [AccelerComm](http://www.accelercomm.com), who have spent lots of time double checking that this code matches the standard.

Have fun! Rob.
